## Tune Share

>
> This project uses django to create a full-stack web application with a React frontend and Python/Django backend, connected by a REST
>API. It allows users to create and/or join virtual "rooms" to listen to music together with their friends/other room members. Once in a
>room, members have the ability to vote to skip the current song as well as vote for the next song to play. It integrates with the Spotify
>Web API to get this play/pause ability and control the order of songs played.
>
>The project was created to help users and their friends connect through music, which I personally very much enjoy.
